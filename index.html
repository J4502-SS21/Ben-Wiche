<p>The mississippi stands stretched out before you. It's late in the afternoon around 4ish. The faint sound of children playing in Audobon Park touches your ears.
A small barge and a Carnival cruise ship flow down the river. You get a text on your phone… It’s Wayne.</p>

</a>

<p>“Gosh dang it Wayne I’ll have to get another taxi…” you think to yourself. “The first one from Louis Armstrong was expensive enough….” </p>

<p>Another Text </p>
<p>Turn Around, and enjoy your new set of wheels!</p>

  <p>From here you’ll take a journey around New Orleans. Links in text will take you to other bits of trivia. This Journey is by no means final and I implore you to do your own research if any of this interests you. Enjoy! -BW</p>
