<h1>The Big Easy Made Easy</h1>
<p>You come to and see the river. It stand's thick and flowing like an old man. It's late in the afternoon around 4ish.
A small barge and a Carnival crew ship flow down the river.You get a text on your phone… It’s Wayne.</p>

<p>So Happy you’re finally visiting! Why don’t we meet me at the Verti Mart for dinner in 45 minutes! </p>

<p>“Gosh dang it Wayne I’ll have to get another taxi…” you think to yourself. “The first one from Louis Armstrong was expensive enough….” </p>

<p>Another Text </p>
<p>Turn Around, and enjoy your new set of wheels!</p>
