    <h1>The Journey Continues!</h1>
    <p>You turn North onto Canal Street. The din of tourists milling about invades your ears. U zig and zag through the afternoon traffic.
    U pass Harrah's a massive downtown casino</p>

    <P> You slow down as you turn right onto Bourbon Street. It's early in the night but people are already milling about the bars</P>

    <p>You've finally made it. The warm GLow of the Verti Mart Draws you in</p>

    </a>

    <p>A creepy building stands across the street. Creepy!</p>
    <p>As you walk into the store, you realize something is off… No one is inside the store, Including Wayne. It seems a bit early for the market to close but you notice a single lit table with a paper bag on it. The bag has a note that says SORRY attached to it.
</p>
<p>-DING-</p>

<p>(A new text from Wayne. It reads “Sorry Boss Man but an urge hit me. I had to end this night up at the lakefront. Left you some food and a map on the back side of the note”)
</p>

<p> As you walk out of the verti marte and bite into your muffuletta. A cool breeze passes through the street. A soft voice enters your ear. </p>

<p> “You’ll search for what you want to find, but it’s all a lie. Enjoy your travels, enjoy the sky” </p>

<P> You turn around, but no ones there. </p>

<p> You speed down Royal Street, past galleries and hotels.</P>

<p> You turn sharply onto Orleans Ave. Who was speaking back at the Verti Marte, you wonder, and why did Dwayne leave you for the lake? As you speed by a lot of stuff. But only a few things catch your eyes. One is a restaraunt with a...</p>

<p>weird name</p>

You push over one of the city's many levees and arrive at City park. This place is a huge rectangle, three miles tall
 by one mile wide, backed to the brim with museums, gardens, walking trails, a school, and a variety of sports fields
 including golf, minigolf, and disc golf courses. You drive by the Art museum and the famous Cafe du Monde
 darting ever farther north. The farther up you go the more suburban the city gets, the more laid back.
</p>

 <p> U pass out of city park and are driving through the tall oak trees of Lake Vista, a prime example of and
 the garden city movement of the UK. The neighborhood is one giant circle with for quadrants all surrounded by
 long parks of greenery that form an x. </p>

 <P>You drive up and reach the Lake. You find no one there you get a new message on you phone. </P>

<P>It’s from who else but Dwayne </P>

<P> The journey was the destination all along<P/>

<P> nonononononononono</P>

<P> Another text "Turn around"<P>

<P> U turn around and their's Dwayne. Sometimes you really hate that guy </P>
