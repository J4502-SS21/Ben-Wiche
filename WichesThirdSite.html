    <h1>The Journey Continues!</h1>
    <p>You turn North onto Canal Street. The din of tourists milling about invades your ears. U zig and zag through the afternoon traffic.
    U pass Harrah's a massive downtown casino</p>

    <P> You slow down as you turn right onto Bourbon Street. It's early in the night but people are already milling about the bars</P>

    <p>You've finally made it. The warm GLow of the Verti Mart Draws you in</p>

    </a>

    <p>A creepy building stands across the street. Creepy!</p>
    <p>As you walk into the store, you realize something is off… No one is inside the store, Including Wayne. It seems a bit early for the market to close but you notice a single lit table with a paper bag on it. The bag has a note that says SORRY attached to it.
</p>
<p>-DING-</p>

<p>(A new text from Wayne. It reads “Sorry Boss Man but an urge hit me. I had to end this night up at the lakefront. Left you some food and a map on the back side of the note”)
</p>

<p> As you walk out of the verti marte and bite into your muffuletta. A cool breeze passes through the street. A soft voice enters your ear. </p>

<p> “You’ll search for what you want to find, but it’s all a lie. Enjoy your travels, enjoy the sky” </p>

<P> You turn around, but no ones there. </p>
